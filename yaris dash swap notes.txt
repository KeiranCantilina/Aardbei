Attempt 1:
Copied block from line 20 to line E0 from old to new. (10 is also copied and contains OD reading)
Result: 
Still no tach; behavior is apparently identical to old dash.

Attempt 2:
Copied block from old to new line 20 to line 60 FF FF FF FF FF FF section (column 5)
Result:
Behaves exactly like new device. Yes tach, Celsius temp, no transmission position, no radio lights.
Conclusion: this line is not responsible for features we care about. The only lines that matter are from 60 column 0C to line E0.

Attempt 3: Same as attempt 2 but copy line 60 column 0C to line 90 column 07 from old to attempt 2.
Result:
Same result as Attempt 2. We now know the features we care about are from line 90 column 09 to line E0.

Attempt 4: Same as attempt 3 but copy line 90 column 09 to line B0 column 0D
Result: Same as attempt 3 except NO TACH!
This means the tach feature is somewhere from line 90 column 09 to line B0 column 0D

Attempt 5: Same as attempt 1 but Line 90 column 09 to line B0 column 0D is copied from new dash EEPROM to attempt 1.
Result: SUCCESS with tach but no speedo

Attempt 6: Same as attempt 1 but Line 20 to line 60 column 05 is copied in from new and tach line (Line 90 column 09 to line B0 column 0D) is copied in from new.
Result:

Attempt 7: Same as new but old is inserted from end of tach line (B0 column 0E) to line E0.
Result: Same as Attempt 5, but now things beep properly! Clearly speedo is somewhere below the tach line.

Attempt 8: Same as attempt 7 but we replace line B0 column 0E to line C0 column 0B with the corresponding section from new.
Result: Behavior is identical to new dash. Therefore, we know that speedo, temp units, lights, and shift position are somewhere in B0 column 0E to line C0 column 0B.

Attempt 9: Same as attempt 7 but we replace line B0 column 0E to line C0 column 05 with the corresponding section from new.
Result: Behavior is identical to new dash. Therefore, we know that speedo, temp units, lights, and shift position are somewhere in line B0 column 0E to line C0 column 05.

Sanity Check attempt 10: Same as new but old is inserted from line B0 column 0E to line C0 column 05.
We expect results identical to Attempt 7. 
Result: Behaves identical to attempt 7.

Attempt 11: Insert line B0 column 0E to line C0 column 03 from new to attempt 10.
Result: Behaves like new dash :(

So the only thing that maters is the 6 bytes from line B0 column 0E to line C0 column 05.

Old dash: D5 5C D5 5C D5 5C
Binary: 1101010101011100 or                                                        11010101 01011100 F, no speedo
New dash: EF DC EF DC EF DC
Binary: 1110111111011100 or                                                        11101111 11011100 C, yes speedo
Only 5 bits are different. maybe they're bools.

For attempt 12, let's try old dash but change one bit:                             11010101 11011100 F?, no speedo
So D5 DC D5 DC D5 DC

Result: Behaves like Attempt 7. Same as old with tach but no speedo.

Attempt 13: Schwip schwap. EF 5C EF 5C EF 5C                                       11101111 01011100 F, yes speedo
Result: Same as New except temperature is in F! And speedo works. Seems like they are bools? Only thing left to fix is gear shift and lights.

Attempt 14: Keep second byte the same, play with first byte. 
            Byte diff is 11XXX1X1 
            Try 11111111 01011100 FF 5C
Result:

Attempt 15: 11000101 01011100 C5 5C
Result:
